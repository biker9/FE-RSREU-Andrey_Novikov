		The results of the campaign 964-965 he could not raise the authority of Russia in the eyes of the Byzantine ally, who tried by all means to attract Svyatoslav to solving foreign policy problems of the Empire. The Byzantine government required people to negotiate with Sviatoslav. The choice fell on the Byzantine diplomat, the son of Chersonesos strategy FEMA (region), Calocyrus. Kalocin was a man as energetic, as ambitious. The language of the Slavs and their manners he knew well, for he met them in the Chersonese, and as a Byzantine officer, shoulder to shoulder with the Slavic Russ fought in Syria against the Muslims.

Map of Constantinople 1422, which was compiled by the Christopher Buondelmonti In Kiev Kalakar signed a lucrative for Byzantine agreement under which brown undertook to compel the submission of the Bulgarian Kingdom. But the ambitious Ambassador secretly dreamed about the Imperial crown. He decided to rely on the army of the Rus and, overthrowing the old Emperor Nicephorus II focus, to seize power in Constantinople.

Performing the contract, Rus landed at the mouth of the Danube, defeated Bulgarian Tsar Peter, and took possession of Bulgaria. Peter soon died, and the captive princes were sent to Byzantium, where they were imprisoned, one pre-oscopic (mutilated thus man was deprived of the right to the throne). Plans Calocyrus were to come true: Prince Svyatoslav Slavic Russes became his friend; in short the transition from Constantinople were Russians wife; came up to him and allies, the Pechenegs.

And in Constantinople there was a situation favorable for Calocyrus. The elderly Nicephorus II Phocas - a great military leader and administrator - was extremely unpopular in his own capital. Foca has supported the monks from mount Athos, speaking for the poor against the rich clergy of the monasteries and bishops. The Emperor severely cut income to the Church.

So he got money on military spending and... the hostility of the Church hierarchy. In addition, the Basileus (Emperor of Byzantium) increased the tax on artisans and fishermen, as taxes increased the price. The urban population was complaining. Focus supported only border soldiers akriti, but they were too far from the capital at a critical point. On top of their troubles Fock was old and ugly. His wife, the Empress of Theophano, gave her heart to the handsome John Tsimishy. Hatched a plot. The conspirators with the help of the Empress entered the Palace and brutally murdered the old Emperor (969). However, becoming Emperor, I tzimiskes sent Theophano and the actual killers, making an exception for themselves on the Aegean Islands.

Unfortunately Calocyrus concept which opened in Foca, I tzimiskes turned out to be able and active commander. The new Basileus gave Svyatoslav and calocyrus created by his predecessor a great army. In addition, Foca had to order the allies of Byzantium - the left Bank of the Pechenegs - attacked Kiev. So Sviatoslav had to leave Bulgaria and move to Russia to save his own capital, his old mother and children. But when he arrived to Kiev, the war has already ended before it began. Coming from the North the troops of the voivode of Pratica stopped the Pechenegs. Their Khan exchanged with Praticam arms and, having made peace, went to the Dnieper steppes.

A. I. Ivanov. Feat young citizen of Kiev during the siege of Kiev by the Pechenegs in 968, Sviatoslav, who had abandoned all in Bulgaria, found that in Kiev, he not to the court. There were stronger Christian community, and it did not suit the Prince of the heathen. Svyatoslav himself disliked Christians, and indeed he was "not a pleasure to sit in Kiev". I must say that Svyatoslav appeared the idea to organize a new capital on the outskirts of their land was not so ridiculous. So did Peter the Great created St. Petersburg, where concentrated the noisy life of the new society. And just as the Swedes did not want to be next to a capital city Petra, the Greeks did not desire a close proximity to the warlike Svyatoslav.

Olga asked him not to leave her. But the Princess soon died, and Sviatoslav returned to Bulgaria, where the situation also has not changed in his favor.

The Byzantines came to the plain of Northern Bulgaria and captured the city of Preslav (Preslav). The Bulgarians quickly moved to the side of the Greeks: eng already disappointed them by violence and cruelty. Time to leave the Preslav squad of Russes with Kalomira went to the Danube in the city perejaslavets. The further fate Calocyrus is unknown to us. The Pechenegs had Sviatoslav. Abandoned by the allies, he with a small retinue resisted now and Byzantine troops and rebels of Bulgaria.
