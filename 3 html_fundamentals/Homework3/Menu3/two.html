		So, Vladimir disgraced himself Rogvolod murder and his sons, who were in no way to blame and even fought with him. He raped the daughter Rogvolod Rogneda. She even wanted to kill Vladimir, in revenge for the death of his father and brothers. Vladimir treacherously killed his own brother. He betrayed his comrades - the Vikings. This prince, and the evidence of record, sin was enough. His reputation as a heavy burden fell warrior Korsun gamble. So, fond memories of him, descendants preserved to our days, may be called undeserved?
    
              No! Historical memory links the image of Vladimir not to his personal qualities and political successes, and to act more substantial - a choice of faith, spiritualized life of the people. In fact, extending his power on almost all Slav Russian land, Vladimir was bound to adhere to what that, as one would say today, a "national" political program that, under the terms of the time, expressed in religious form.

              To religion (theistic systems of the world) have a significant impact on the situation in Eastern Europe in the tenth century., Are the following: Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Islam. Russian "faith-seekers" were present and it is imagined differences between these major religions. The latter is not surprising: Kiev merchants and soldiers constantly been in Constantinople, fought in Crete and Asia Minor and traded with the Egyptians and the Syrians went to the Volga Bulgaria and Khorezm. The adoption of a particular faith, and automatically led to a focus on well-defined groups within the country. Therefore, the upcoming Prince Vladimir "choice of faith" can not be called easy. And after all this problem was an international dimension, due to the constant superethnic contacts.

              During that preceded the baptism of Rus, grew ominous signs of the coming split in the hitherto united Christendom. Here at the heart of the ideological disputes were also natural, objective processes of ethnogenesis. Is in the phase of passionate lifting Western European superethnic integrity felt different from other superethnoi very sharply and enters it in the vestments of the church superiority, calling "Christendom" only himself. The struggle between Orthodoxy and Catholicism began to move from the sphere of theological controversy in the realm of politics.

              Showing Greek philosopher curtains depicting Jesus Christ Vladimir Svyatoslavich. Miniature from Radziwill Chronicle German Emperor Otto II at the Imperial Diet of 983 in Verona has made a decision on the war against the "Greeks and Saracens." Such equalization of Orthodox Christians and Muslims are no longer allowed to talk about the unity of the Church of Christ, made a very real threat to the Catholic onslaught of the East, including to Russia. In Russia understood this all too well, since before the Diet of Verona Catholic Polish king Mieszko I fought with the prince of Kiev because of the scarlet Russia (Galicia), as already mentioned Otto II - with the Western Slavs on the Elbe (Labe).

              The very circumstances "choice of faith" Vladimir is widely known and are described in the "Tale of Bygone Years". In accordance with the version of Nestor, the prince, in order to understand the different confessions, he sent envoys to neighboring land and then took the then representatives of all the exercises. How realistic are these details, we were not so important, because much more important given Vladimir rationale for its decision to be baptized in the Greek rite.

             Speaking about the motives, we note that, in addition to the dogmas, in any religion, there are customs, traditionally passed down from generation to generation. Such practices for new believers sometimes matter more than the sacred books, especially if the books are written in an incomprehensible language. So, the main book of Islam - the Koran - written in Arabic, the Slavs incomprehensible. The customs of Muslims, for example, not to drink wine, do not eat pork, simple, but for the Slavs were unacceptable. And here's why. According to Russian tradition, the prince shared a meal with a team. This mandatory ritual cement a friendship with Prince warriors, and what could be more important for a prince? Less significant, but quite significant was another factor. Slavs and Ruses are used to intoxicating drinks as wine and beer relieves fatigue hikes, but a strict ritual feasts would not allow "a riot when he was drunk." Of course, the Arabs converted to Islam, have not stopped to drink wine, but did so in a narrow circle of relatives and friends, in public places being sober. They had no ritual feasts and their respective behaviors. As a result, Muslim mullahs Vladimir refused the famous words: "Russia has Petey joy ..."

              More complicated reasons for the refusal of Vladimir Germans Catholics. His words are not clear, "Go where you came from, and because our fathers did not accept this." Try to understand that it is "not taken fathers." In the middle of the tenth century. Rus came with the mission of Bishop Adalbert baptism of Princess Olga and Kiev. Adalbert failed, but "not of their negligence."

              It is known that in the middle of the century to the Holy See ascended sometimes very sinful pope. In 955 the papal throne sat down on the youth of sixteen, named by Pope John XII. Vatican courtyard has become a den of corrupt women. If the Pope was only a hunter, player, red tape and a drunkard, it would be so bad. But the Roman pontiff gave feasts with libations in honor of the ancient pagan gods and drank to the health of Satan. Of course, news of these "exploits" reached Russia. The chronological coincidence of atrocities in Rome Adalbert expulsion from Kiev can not be a coincidence. Therefore, the rejection of the Latin tradition of faith and conscious choice actually goes back to the Greek ancestors of Vladimir prince at table: Princess Olga and her grandson Yaropolk.

              But the story of the rise to Vladimir Khazar Jews - an example of an explicit literary works of Nestor. Jews allegedly confessed to Vladimir, "betrayed byst hresteyanom our land." In fact, in the tenth. Palestine was in the hands of Muslims. Chronicler shifted dates. It is noteworthy that, according to the chronicle, Vladimir did not apply to the Jews, but only took them to drive away. Hence, the chronicle of Nestor records last attempt Khazar Jews to seize the prince of Kiev, made when the Khazar Khanate did not exist. Exodus attempts known: Vladimir was perceptive.

              Military political consequences of the choice of faith was very large. The choice made not only gave Vladimir strong ally - Byzantium, and reconciling it with its own population of the capital. Some had resisted baptism at first, preferring paganism, Novgorod and Chernigov. But pagans Novgorod were broken by force, and after a while, along with Smolensk Chernihiv also embraced Christianity. Now the prince of Kiev remained a foreign policy problems.

              In the steppes between Russia and the Black Sea prevailed Pechenegs. It Pechenegs bogatevshie on trade with Korsun and Byzantium, they were against Prince Vladimir. We know only the result of the collision, which allegedly resulted in a considerable war; Vladimir had a palisade fence their land, put the "Watchmen" and renounce hegemony in the southern Russian steppes and the exit to the Black Sea.

              The enemies of Russian and Byzantine - Pechenegs - in the tenth century. were pagans. In the XI century. the tribe to accept Islam. Appeal to Islam was accompanied by the civil war. Some nomads cross, but the majority, converted to Islam, became a feud with the Greeks. Conversion to Islam, the war with Byzantium and internal turmoil tie forces nomads and by the end of the first third of the XI century. saved Russia from Pecheneg threat.

              What is happening in Russia? We see how the Orthodox Church gradually spread its beneficial effects, built churches and monasteries, taught people to read and write and painting. Only in Rostov (Merya in the ground) for a long time remained the two urban communities: Christian and pagan. At one end of the city was the Orthodox Church, the other was to measure the temple of God Keremet. At the same time Christians and pagans have coexisted quite peacefully, but after They gave especially bothersome killed two missionaries, and they all left alone.

              So, Vladimir went on the road, which identified "the wisest of men" Princess Olga, has chosen Orthodoxy. Stepping on this way, dropping the oppression of merchant capital radhanite, Russia came to the baptism of 988. The strength of Orthodoxy was preaching in the political moderation of the Byzantine Empire, and the sincerity of the Patriarchs of Constantinople, and the charm of the Greek liturgy (church service).

              Byzantium was wanted by Russia of friendship and stop the senseless attacks on the Black Sea coast. Greek theologians flavored preaching Orthodoxy crafty political intricacies. Important was the fact that Orthodoxy is not preached the idea of ??predestination. And because the responsibility for the sins perpetrated by their own free will, laid down on the sinner. It was understandable and acceptable to the Gentiles. The adoption of Christian morality was not psychological violence for the converts, who are accustomed to the elementary opposition of good and evil. Welcome and wisdom of Christianity in 988, fought with Perun and the desire for profit - the real God radhanite. Baptism gave our ancestors the highest freedom - the freedom to choose between good and evil, and the victory of Orthodoxy gave Russia a thousand years of history.2
