		Let's try to look at the ethnic history of our country. In those ages, when began the history of our country and its peoples, mankind has populated the Earth very unevenly. Some peoples have lived in the mountains, others in the plains or dense forests, others on the shores of seas. And all created a very special culture, different from each other, but associated with those landscapes that they were fed. It is clear that the Treefolk have a productive hunt, for example, to obtain furs and sold them, to get what they lacked. But it could not do nor the inhabitants of the sultry Egypt, where fur-bearing animals was not, nor the inhabitants of Western Europe, where the weasels were so rare that their fur was only on the Royal robes nor the nomads engaged in animal husbandry. But the nomads were in abundance meat and milk, they made a delicious and nutritious non-perishable cheese, and could sell it. Who? Yes the Treefolk, izgotavlivaem wooden carts, which could drive the nomads. And most importantly, the forest dwellers were doing the tar, which does not rotate the wheels of the carts of the steppe. The inhabitants of the Mediterranean coast there is a magnificent fish and olives, on the slopes of the Apennines and the Pyrenees were goats. So, each nation had its own method of farming, a way to sustain life. Therefore, we must begin the study of the history of peoples with a description of the nature and climate of the areas where they live.

The division into geographical areas is often arbitrary and not always the same as dividing by climatic region. So, Europe is divided by an air boundary, the corresponding isotherm of January, which runs through the Baltic States, Western Belarus and Ukraine to the Black sea. East of that boundary average temperature in January is negative, the winter is cold, frosty, often dry, and the West is dominated by warm wet winters in which the ground slush, and the air fog. The climate in these regions are completely different.
The great scientist, academician A. A. Shakhmatov, who began the practical study of Russian Chronicles, exploring the history of the Russian language and its dialects, came to the conclusion that the ancient Slavs originated in the upper reaches of the Vistula, on the banks of the Tisza river and Carpathian slopes. It is a modern Eastern Hungary and southern Poland.
Thus, our ancestors the Slavs appeared for the first time and have left their mark in history on the border of two climatic regions (Western European - Eastern European and wet - dry continental climate), and this area is especially interesting for us.
