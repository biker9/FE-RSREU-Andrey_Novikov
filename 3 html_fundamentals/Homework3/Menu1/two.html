		In VI-VIII centuries Slavs - the people are strong and energetic - had a great success. The population grew not so much at the expense of monogamous marriages, many thanks to the captured concubines. The Slavs spread to the North, where they were called Veneti (this word is still preserved in Estonian). In the South they were called sklavyny, in the East - ants. Ukrainian historian M. Y. Braychevsky established that the Greek word "Anta" means the same as Slavic "meadow". Preserved the word is feminine "Polanica" in the sense of "bogatyrs". But the word "meadow" in a similar sense today is not used because the Turkic word "hero" drove him from eating.

In this image: the settling of the Slavs in the IX To the VI century the Slavs occupied Volhynia (Volyn) and the southern steppes to the Black sea (and ukichi tyvertsi). Was taken by the Slavs and also of the Pripyat basin, where he settled Drevlyans, and southern Belarus, where he settled the dregovichs ("dragva" - swamp). In the Northern part of Belarus was settled by Western Slavs - wends. In addition, already in the VII or VIII century two other West Slavic tribes - Radimichi and the Vyatichi had spread South and East to the coolant inflow of the Dnieper and Oka, a tributary of the Volga, settled among the local Ugro Finnish tribes.

For the Slavs was the scourge of the neighborhood by ancient Russ, which made their fishing raids on neighbors. At the time, Rus, defeated the Goths, fled partly to the East, partly to the South into the lower reaches of the Danube, where they came from in Austria, where they are in relationship from gurulov Odoacer (the further fate of this branch we are not interested). Part of the Rus went to the East, took three cities, which have become the reference bases for further campaigns. These were Cuiaba (Kiev), Artania (Beloozero) and Old Rus. Rus Rob their neighbors, kill their men, and captured women and children were sold to slave merchants.

Slavs settled in small groups in the villages; to defend against Rusov caught a terrible robbers, it was difficult for them. Prey to the ruses became more valuable. And then there were valuable furs, honey, wax, and children. The uneven battle lasted long and ended in favor of the ruses, to the authorities when they came Rurik.

Prince Rurik. Engraving 1805 Biography Rurik difficult. By profession he was a Varangian, that is, a hired warrior. In origin brown. It seems, he was connected with the southern Baltic. He allegedly traveled to Denmark, where he met with the Frankish king Charles the Bald. After, in 862, he returned to Novgorod, where he seized power with the help of a certain elder gostomysl. (We do not know exactly does the word "Gostomysl" is the proper name of a person or a household name, the designation of who "thinks" that is, sympathize with, "guests" of the aliens.) Soon in Novgorod uprising against Rurik, led by Vadim Brave. But Rurik killed Vadim and the newly conquered Novgorod and the surrounding area: Ladoga, Beloozero and Izborsk.

There is a legend about two brothers Rurik, Sineus and Truvor, resulting from the misunderstanding of the words of the chronicle: "Rurik and his relatives (sine hus ) and retainers (thru voring )". Vigilantes Rurik planted in Izborsk, the relatives have headed further on Beloozero, itself, based on lake Ladoga, where there was a Varangian settlement, villages in Novgorod. So, by obedience to the surrounding Slavs, Finno-Ugric peoples and the Balts, he created his power.

In this image: Viktor Vasnetsov. The Varangians According to the chronicle, Rurik died in 879, leaving a son, whose name was Igor, the Scandinavian Ingvar, that is "younger". Because Igor, according to the chronicler, was "Detsky Velma" ("very small"), according to the chronicler, the government adopted the Governor named Helga, that is Oleg. Helga - it was not even a name, and the title of the Scandinavian chiefs, which meant both "witch" and "war chief". Oleg and warriors moved along the great route from "the Varangians to the Greeks": from Novgorod South along the river Lovat where he was Perevoloka, and further along the Dnieper river, in passing having occupied Smolensk. The Vikings Oleg and young Igor came to Kyiv. Then Slavs lived there and there was a small Russian team of Askold. Oleg enticed Askold and dir leader of the Slavs on the Bank of the Dnieper, and there treacherously murdered them. Then Dynamo without any resistance obeyed the new rulers. This occurred in 882

Oleg took Pskov and in 883, was betrothed young Igor with Olga of Pskov. Olga is the feminine gender of the name Oleg. Here we are again faced with a title without knowing what the name of a historic person. Probably, Olga and Igor, at the time of betrothal was a kid.

By the IX century the schism of Slavic unity led to the creation of new, previously non-existent Nations. As a result of mixing Slavs with the Illyrians came the Serbs and the Croats, and in Thrace mixing with alien nomads marked the beginning of the Bulgarian ethnos. Some Slavic tribes penetrated into Greece and Macedonia, he reached the Peloponnese, which they called Morea (from "the sea"). The growing passion of the Slavs scattered them throughout Europe.
