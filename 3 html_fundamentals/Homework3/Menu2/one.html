Next to Kiev's power in Eastern Europe arose a mighty state - the Khazar Khaganate. The history it deserves attention. The Khazars themselves were one of the great Nations of the era. Initially, their settlement was concentrated in the lower reaches of the Terek and along the shores of the Caspian sea. At that time the water level in the Caspian sea stood at $ 36, in other words, 8 m lower than it is now. Because very large was the territory of the Volga Delta, bordering on Buzachi Peninsula - continuation of Mangyshlak. It was a real Caspian the Netherlands, abounding in fish.

V. M. Vasnetsov. Battle of the Scythians with the Slavs Khazars - the Caucasian tribe who lived on the territory of modern Dagestan. The author of these lines had occasion to find in the lower Volga, their skeletons; they seemed to belong to the teenagers. The length of the skeleton is about 1.6 m, the bones themselves are small and fragile. A similar anthropological type is preserved by the Terek Cossacks. Traces of habitation from the Khazars of the Caspian sea are hidden now coming by sea, and only Dagestan grapes brought from the Caucasus by the Khazars in the Volga Delta, remains a Testament to their migration.

Enemies of the Caspian Khazars were nomads, the Bulgars and Burtases. And those, and others in the VI century the Turks subdued. At the beginning of the winning dynastic strife among the Turks leaned over Bulgar, Khazar on other. Defeated the Khazars and their allies. Steppe Bulgars fled to the Middle Volga, where he founded the city of Great Bolgar. The other part of the Bulgar Horde, led by Khan Asparukh went to the Danube, where, mingling with South Slavic tribes, marked the beginning of a new people - Bulgarians. But we are currently interested Khazars.

Map of the Khazar khanate in the tenth century, The Khazars were not public authorities. Now from the language of this tribe is preserved is one word that served as the name of the fortress Sarkel, which means "white house". Turkic, Finno Ugric and Slavic languages does not know anything similar to this name.

In VII-VIII centuries the Khazars came under pressure advancing through the Caucasus the Arabs. In this war they helped the Turks - a people so brave and warlike. They were the first in Central Asia mastered a powerful weapon of the horseman - sword. And for what it was. Turks waged frequent war with China, ruled the Tang dynasty.

The Tang dynasty (618-907) ruled China skillfully and successfully. The rice under the Tang rulers were cheaper than ever. The Chinese have actively communicated with its "West": the turks, the Sogdians, the Tibetans and even the Arabs. Representatives of the Tang dynasty, dreamed of creating a vast Asian Empire that would include not only the Median plain (today's China), but also the steppes of Mongolia, the forests of Manchuria and the oases of Sogdiana. Tan struggle for Imperial power over Asia began with a victory over the Turks in the mid-seventh century

The representative of the broken Turkic dynasty fled to the Khazars. The Khazars took him and... did their Khan. Khan Turk they are very satisfied. He wandered with his stake in the lower reaches of the Volga river, between present Volgograd and Astrakhan in the spring they migrated to the Terek, summer is spent between the Terek, the Kuban and the Don, and with the advent of cold weather returned to the Volga. The Khazars did not have to contain its own Khan. He didn't demand taxes from them, feeding their own nomadic agriculture. Khan and the military came to him to know, satisfied with the gifts of his subjects, did not introduce systems of levies and not engaged in trade. The Turkic khans and beks, leading Khazars, who by that time quite peaceful, had organized their defense against the Arabs. They come from Azerbaijan via Derbent on the Terek, and the Volga. Turks - a people of warriors, was protected by Khazars against enemies and together with them formed the Caspian sea a small country.

And here is the Turkic Khazar state experienced the introduction of a people whose traditions and culture.Thus, our ancestors the Slavs appeared for the first time and have left their mark in history on the border of two climatic regions (Western European - Eastern European and wet - dry continental climate), and this area is especially interesting for us.
