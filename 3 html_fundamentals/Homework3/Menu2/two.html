	Unsuccessfully resisted the Khazars in the beginning of X century Kiev. We remember that the attempt of ruses to capture Concerts and establish themselves on the shores of the Azov sea provoked a campaign of the commander of the Passover and put Kiev in the position of a tributary itilic merchants of radhanites. When the collection of tribute to the Khazars in the Drevlyan land was killed by Igor, Prince of Kiev and Olga's husband (944). The resistance of the Khazars, and not the war with Byzantium had become the main problem for Kiev. And because Princess Olga of Kiev, who ruled for a small son Svyatoslav, tried to buy in the face of a powerful ally of the Greeks: she went to Constantinople, where he accepted the baptism, choosing his godfather the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus.

Here we are again faced with a clear chronological confusion of Nestor and other chroniclers. According to the Novgorod first chronicle, Olga was born in 893 in Constantinople visited 955 m. She was supposed to be already 62 years old, and Nestor assures us that Constantine was so enchanted with Olga that he wanted to marry her. In our opinion, the visit of Olga to Constantinople and baptism took place about 10 years earlier - in, 946

N. K. Roerich. Watch Back on the solid ground of established facts, we are convinced of the reality of the campaign of Svyatoslav against the Khazars. The young Prince trapped energetic military leader, began in the summer of 964 Svyatoslav decided not to go from Kiev to the Volga directly through the steppes. It was very dangerous, because a tribe of Northmen that lived along the road between Chernigov and Kursk, was a supporter of the Khazars. Rose Rus on the Dnieper river to its headwaters and dragged the boat to the eye. On the Oka and Volga and Svyatoslav came to the Khazar capital of ITIL.

Svyatoslav's allies in the campaign 964-965, was made by the Pechenegs and guzy. The Pechenegs, the Byzantine Empire and supporters of the natural enemies of the Khazars, came to the aid of the rocket from the West. Their way, most likely, ran at the present village of Kalachinsk, where the don comes near the Volga river. Guzy came from the river Yaik, crossing dunes covered the expanses of the Caspian. The allies successfully met the ITIL.

The capital of Khazaria was located on a huge island (19 km in width), formed by two channels of the Volga: the Volga (from the West) and the Akhtuba river (from the East). Akhtuba in those days was like a full-flowing river like the Volga. In the city there were stone synagogue and the Palace of the king, rich wooden houses of radhanites. Was and stone mosque, because the Muslims there asked politely.

E. A. Lansere. Prince Svyatoslav on the way to Constantinople the Warriors of Sviatoslav cut all the way from ITIL. But its inhabitants must have known about the approach of the Russians, and the majority of aboriginal Khazars fled to the Volga Delta. The Volga Delta was a natural fortress: in the maze of ducts could only deal local. Incredible in the summer clouds of mosquitoes that appear at sunset, would defeat any army. In winter the Volga river was ice bound, and Delta became inaccessible to boats. The Islands of the Delta were covered with bear's hills - great hills with a height of four-storey house. These bumps and were given asylum real Khazars.

In another situation the Jewish population. To study the ducts of the Volga Jewish merchants and their families, there was no point: the reason they created their monopoly of foreign trade and usury, to live in the comfort of the artificial landscape of the city. The Jews were alien to the indigenous people - the Khazars, whom they exploited. Of course, that the Khazars their rulers, to put it mildly, did not like and to save them wasn't going to.

In the besieged city to the Jews there was nowhere to run, because they came to fight with Svyatoslav and were defeated. The survivors fled "black" lands to the Terek river and hid in Dagestan. ("Black" lands North of the Terek was called because of the snowy winters in this area strong winds easily lifted with snow dust, and there is a "black" blizzards.)

Sviatoslav reached the Terek. There stood the second largest city of the Khazar Jews - Samandar. In and around the city was four thousand vineyards. (Now is the space between the villages Shali and Greben; it is described by L. N. Tolstoy in the novel "the Cossacks".) Samandar had a square citadel, but she did not save the city. Svyatoslav defeated Samandar, and taking the population of horses, oxen, carts, moved across the river don in Russia. On the way home he took another Khazar fortress of Sarkel, located near the present village of Tsimlyanskaya. Sarkel was built by the Byzantines during their short friendship with Khazaria, and it was created by the Greek architect Petrona. In Sarkel Svyatoslav met the garrison, which consisted of mercenary nomads. Prince gained a victory, destroyed the fortress, and the town was renamed in the White Tower. In the future, there settled immigrants from Chernigov land. Taking sarkela finished victorious campaign of Svyatoslav in Khazaria.

As a result of the campaign 964-965, Svyatoslav excluded from the sphere of influence of the Jewish community of the Volga river, middle flow of Terek and part of the Middle don. But not all political military problems have been solved. In the Kuban region, in Northern Crimea, in the middle of nowhere Jewish population under the name Khazars still held their leading positions and preserved the financial impact. However, the main achievement of the campaign, no doubt, was that Kievan Rus regained independence.
